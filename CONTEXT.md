## PROJECT STANDARDS

### Code Organization
- **Design Pattern:** Object-oriented programming
- **File Structure:** One class per file (maximum 500 lines)
- **Import Style:** Absolute imports from package root
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `BookkeeperEngine`, `TransactionManager`)
  - Functions/Methods: snake_case (e.g., `process_transaction`, `extract_data`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`)
  - Private methods: Leading underscore (e.g., `_internal_helper`, `_validate_input`)

### Code Quality
- **Type Hints:** Required for all function signatures
- **Docstrings:** Required for all classes and public methods (Google style)
- **Input Validation:** All public methods must validate inputs
- **Error Handling:** Use specific exceptions, not bare `except:`
- **Logging:** Use logging module (not print statements)
- **Test Coverage:** Maintain above 80%

### File Headers
All Python files must include:
```python
"""
Module: <module_name>
Purpose: <brief description>
Author: Stephen Bogner
Created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
"""
```

## COMMON PATTERNS

### Logging Setup
```python
import logging
from agentic_bookkeeper.utils.logger import (
    get_logger,
    log_operation_start,
    log_operation_success,
    log_operation_failure,
)

logger = get_logger(__name__)

# Structured logging pattern (T-053):
start_time = time.time()
log_operation_start(logger, "operation_name", context_key="value")

try:
    # Do work...
    duration_ms = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
    log_operation_success(logger, "operation_name", duration_ms=duration_ms, result="success")
except Exception as e:
    duration_ms = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
    log_operation_failure(logger, "operation_name", e, duration_ms=duration_ms)
    raise
```

### Input Validation Pattern
```python
def process_data(self, data: dict) -> Result:
    """Process input data with validation.

    Args:
        data: Dictionary containing data to process

    Returns:
        Result object with processing outcome

    Raises:
        ValueError: If data is invalid
        TypeError: If data is wrong type
    """
    if not isinstance(data, dict):
        raise TypeError(f"Expected dict, got {type(data)}")

    if 'required_field' not in data:
        raise ValueError("Missing required field: required_field")

    # Process data...
```

### Test Structure Pattern
```python
import pytest
from agentic_bookkeeper.module import ClassName

class TestClassName:
    """Test suite for ClassName."""

    @pytest.fixture
    def instance(self):
        """Create test instance."""
        return ClassName()

    def test_method_success(self, instance):
        """Test method succeeds with valid input."""
        result = instance.method(valid_input)
        assert result == expected_output

    def test_method_invalid_input(self, instance):
        """Test method raises error with invalid input."""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            instance.method(invalid_input)
```

  - Cache keys: "{start_date}|{end_date}|{transaction_type}"
  - Cache hit on repeated queries avoids redundant database calls
  - Cache management: clear_cache() and get_cache_stats() methods
  - Cache invalidation: Should be called after CRUD operations
- Image optimization:
  - Reduced PDF rendering from 300 DPI to 200 DPI (33% faster, still high quality)
  - Added image resizing for large images (max 2048px dimension)
  - JPEG compression with quality=85 reduces file size while maintaining clarity
  - LLM vision models work optimally with 2048x2048 or smaller images
- Testing:
  - 6 new caching tests (100% passing)
  - Coverage on report_generator.py: 98% (maintained)
  - Total: 560 tests (558 solid + 2 flaky), 91% coverage maintained
- Key learnings:
  - Composite indexes are critical for multi-column filter queries
  - Caching simple date range queries provides significant performance boost
  - Image size optimization reduces memory usage and API payload size
  - DPI reduction from 300â†’200 is imperceptible to LLM quality but noticeable in speed
  - Cache should be cleared after transactions are added/updated/deleted
  - Use cache_key format that includes all query parameters for correctness
- Files modified: database.py (+2 indexes), report_generator.py (+caching), document_processor.py (+image optimization)
- Phase 5 (Refinement & Distribution) started - 1/9 tasks complete
