## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Test Results Summary
- **Total Transaction Management Tests:** 128 tests, all passing
- **Module Coverage:**
  - transactions_widget.py: 86% coverage
  - transaction_edit_dialog.py: 89% coverage
  - transaction_add_dialog.py: 91% coverage
  - document_review_dialog.py: 90% coverage
- **Test Execution Time:** 1.9s (excellent performance)
- **Comprehensive workflow testing:** CRUD operations, validation, UI interactions

### Test Breakdown by Module

**Transactions Widget (35 tests):**
- Initialization and widget creation
- Transaction loading and display
- Filtering (type, category, date range, search)
- Sorting by columns
- Selection and double-click
- Add/Edit/Delete operations
- Backend integration
- Error handling

**Transaction Edit Dialog (31 tests):**
- Initialization with transaction data
- Form field population
- Validation rules (4 rules)
- Save operation
- Category filtering by jurisdiction
- Button behavior
- Edge cases

**Transaction Add Dialog (29 tests):**
- Initialization with defaults
- Form field setup
- Validation rules
- Create operation
- Category handling
- Integration with widget

**Document Review Dialog (33 tests):**
- Layout and widgets
- Document preview
- Form population
