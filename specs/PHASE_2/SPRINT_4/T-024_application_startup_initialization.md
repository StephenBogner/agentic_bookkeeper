- Implement first-run detection
- Create first-run welcome dialog
- Initialize database on first run
- Load configuration
- Initialize logging
- Create data directories if needed
- Handle startup errors gracefully

### Non-Functional Requirements

## EXPECTED DELIVERABLES

**Files Created:**
- `src/agentic_bookkeeper/main.py` (224 lines)
- `main.py` (launcher script in project root)
- `src/agentic_bookkeeper/tests/test_main.py` (328 lines)

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Files Created
- Main application entry point with initialization logic
- Launcher script for easy execution
- Comprehensive test suite (18 tests)

### Test Results

### Features Implemented
- First-run detection using sentinel file
- Welcome dialog on first run (QMessageBox)
- Database initialization on first run
- Configuration loading and validation
- Logging setup with file and console handlers
