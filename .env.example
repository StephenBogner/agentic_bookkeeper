# Agentic Bookkeeper Configuration Template
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
#
# IMPORTANT - Environment Variable Precedence:
# Configuration values are loaded in the following order (highest to lowest priority):
#   1. System environment variables (e.g., set in ~/.bashrc, /etc/environment)
#   2. Session environment variables (e.g., export VAR=value)
#   3. .env file values (DEVELOPMENT ONLY - do not use in production)
#
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
# - Production/Staging: ALWAYS use system or session environment variables for API keys
# - Development: .env file is acceptable but should be in .gitignore (it is)
# - Never commit actual API keys to version control
# - The .env file is loaded only if variables are not already set in the environment

# LLM Provider Configuration
# Choose one: openai, anthropic, xai, google
LLM_PROVIDER=openai

# API Keys (get from respective provider websites)
# These will be read from environment first, then fall back to .env
# In production, set these as system environment variables instead:
#   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# Tax Jurisdiction
# Choose one: CRA (Canada), IRS (United States)
TAX_JURISDICTION=CRA

# Fiscal Year Start Date (MM-DD format)
FISCAL_YEAR_START=01-01

# Directory Configuration
WATCH_DIRECTORY=./data/watch
PROCESSED_DIRECTORY=./data/processed
DATABASE_PATH=./data/bookkeeper.db

# Logging Configuration
