# Dashboard Statistics Display Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Issue:** Dashboard Quick Statistics showing $0.00 despite transactions in database
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Problem Description

After successfully starting monitoring, the Dashboard's "Quick Statistics" section displayed all zeros:
- Total Income: $0.00
- Total Expenses: $0.00
- Net Income: $0.00
- Transactions: 0

However, the "Recent Transactions" table correctly showed 2 transactions:
- 2025-10-24: Office Supplies expense ($49.99)
- 2025-10-23: Consulting Revenue income ($1,500.00)

**Expected Statistics:**
- Total Income: $1,500.00
- Total Expenses: $49.99
- Net Income: $1,450.01
- Transactions: 2

---

## Root Cause

The dashboard was accessing the statistics dictionary with **incorrect keys**.

### What `get_transaction_statistics()` Returns

**File:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/core/transaction_manager.py:356`

The method returns a **nested structure**:
```python
{
    "income": {
        "count": 1,
        "total": 1500.0,
        "avg": 1500.0,
        "min": 1500.0,
        "max": 1500.0
    },
    "expense": {
        "count": 1,
        "total": 49.99,
        "avg": 49.99,
        "min": 49.99,
        "max": 49.99
    },
    "net": 1450.01
}
```

### What the Dashboard Was Trying to Access

**File:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/gui/dashboard_widget.py:333` (BEFORE FIX)

```python
total_income = stats.get("total_income", 0.0)    # ❌ Key doesn't exist!
total_expenses = stats.get("total_expense", 0.0) # ❌ Key doesn't exist!
transaction_count = stats.get("count", 0)        # ❌ Key doesn't exist!
```

All three keys don't exist at the top level, so they all returned the default value of `0.0` or `0`.

## Solution Implemented

Updated the statistics access pattern to match the actual data structure.

**File:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/gui/dashboard_widget.py:333-351`

### Before Fix (Broken)

```python
# Update income
total_income = stats.get("total_income", 0.0)
self.income_label.setText(f"${total_income:,.2f}")

# Update expenses
total_expenses = stats.get("total_expense", 0.0)
self.expense_label.setText(f"${total_expenses:,.2f}")

# Update net income
net_income = total_income - total_expenses
self.net_label.setText(f"${net_income:,.2f}")

# Update transaction count
transaction_count = stats.get("count", 0)
self.count_label.setText(str(transaction_count))
```

**Result:** All values show as $0.00 and 0

### After Fix (Working)

```python
# Update income
total_income = stats.get("income", {}).get("total", 0.0)
self.income_label.setText(f"${total_income:,.2f}")

# Update expenses
total_expenses = stats.get("expense", {}).get("total", 0.0)
self.expense_label.setText(f"${total_expenses:,.2f}")

# Update net income
net_income = stats.get("net", 0.0)
self.net_label.setText(f"${net_income:,.2f}")

# Update transaction count (sum of income and expense counts)
income_count = stats.get("income", {}).get("count", 0)
expense_count = stats.get("expense", {}).get("count", 0)
transaction_count = income_count + expense_count
self.count_label.setText(str(transaction_count))
```

**Result:** Correctly displays all statistics from database

## Changes Made

### File Modified
- **`src/agentic_bookkeeper/gui/dashboard_widget.py`**
  - Lines 335-351: Updated statistics access pattern to use nested dictionary keys

### Lines Changed
- **Total:** 10 lines modified (data access pattern)

---

## Validation

### Test Data
```python
stats = {
    "income": {"count": 1, "total": 1500.0, ...},
    "expense": {"count": 1, "total": 49.99, ...},
    "net": 1450.01
}
```

### Test Results
```
✓ Total Income: $1,500.00
✓ Total Expenses: $49.99
✓ Net Income: $1,450.01
✓ Transaction Count: 2

✓ All statistics calculations correct!
```

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (Restart Application)

1. **Close the application** (if running)
2. **Restart:**
   ```bash
   ./run_bookkeeper.sh
   ```
3. **Check Dashboard tab:**
   - Should now show correct statistics
   - Total Income: $1,500.00
   - Total Expenses: $49.99
   - Net Income: $1,450.01
   - Transactions: 2

### Alternative: Click "Refresh Now"

If application is already running:
1. Click the **"Refresh Now"** button at the bottom of the Dashboard
2. Statistics should update to show correct values

---

## Why This Bug Happened

This bug was introduced in the original dashboard implementation and wasn't caught because:

1. **Mock Tests:** UAT testing used mocked data that returned the expected flat structure
2. **No Integration Tests:** No tests verified the dashboard with real TransactionManager
3. **API Mismatch:** Developer assumed flat dictionary but TransactionManager returns nested structure

---

## Related Code Patterns

The TransactionManager uses nested structures throughout:

**Report Generator:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/core/report_generator.py`
```python
stats = self.transaction_manager.get_transaction_statistics(start_date, end_date)
total_income = stats["income"]["total"]  # ✓ Correct pattern
total_expenses = stats["expense"]["total"]  # ✓ Correct pattern
```

The dashboard should have followed this same pattern from the start.

## Impact Analysis

### What This Fixes
✅ Dashboard Quick Statistics now display correctly
✅ All four statistic boxes show accurate values from database
✅ "Refresh Now" button properly updates statistics
✅ Auto-refresh (if enabled) shows current statistics

### No Changes To
- Transaction loading (was working correctly)
- Recent transactions table (was working correctly)
- Monitoring functionality (working after previous fixes)
- Any backend logic or data storage

## Files Modified Summary

| File | Lines Changed | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `src/agentic_bookkeeper/gui/dashboard_widget.py` | 10 | Fix statistics access to use nested dictionary keys |

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Match Data Structures:** Always check what the API actually returns, not what you assume
2. **Integration Testing:** Mock tests must match real API structure
3. **Follow Patterns:** Check how other code uses the same API (ReportGenerator had it correct)
4. **Runtime Testing:** Some bugs only appear with real data, not mocked tests
