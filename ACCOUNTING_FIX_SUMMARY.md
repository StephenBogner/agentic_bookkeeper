# Accounting Terminology Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (affects financial accuracy)

---

## Problem Statement

The system was incorrectly classifying invoices and receipts, leading to reversed income/expense transactions:

- ❌ Invoices sometimes marked as **expense** (should be **income**)
- ❌ Receipts sometimes marked as **income** (should be **expense**)

This is critical because it directly impacts:

- Profit/loss calculations
- Tax reporting
- Financial statements
- Cash flow analysis

## Correct Accounting Terminology

### From Business Owner's Perspective

| Document | Issued By | Received By | Transaction Type | Meaning |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| **Invoice** | Your business | Customer | **INCOME** | Money you expect to receive |
| **Receipt** | Vendor | Your business | **EXPENSE** | Money you paid out |

### The Rule

```text
Invoice = Income (you bill customers)
Receipt = Expense (you pay vendors)
```

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Updated LLM Prompt

**File**: `src/agentic_bookkeeper/llm/llm_provider.py`

**Changes**:

- Added CRITICAL section explaining invoice→income, receipt→expense
- Added clear document type indicators:
  - Invoice: "INVOICE", "Bill To", "Due Date", "Payment Terms"
  - Receipt: "RECEIPT", "Thank you for your purchase", "Paid"
- Added REMEMBER reminder at end of prompt
- Used strong language: "MUST be", "CRITICAL", "IMPORTANT"

**Before**:

```text
Document Type: Identify if this is an invoice, receipt, or payment record.
```

**After**:

```text
CRITICAL: First identify the document type, then set transaction type accordingly:

- INVOICE: Document requesting payment → transaction_type MUST be "income"
- RECEIPT: Document acknowledging payment received → transaction_type MUST be "expense"

IMPORTANT:
- Invoices = INCOME (money the business expects to receive)
- Receipts = EXPENSE (money the business has paid out)

REMEMBER: invoice→income, receipt→expense. This is critical for correct accounting.
```

---

### 2. ✅ Added Validation Logic

**File**: `src/agentic_bookkeeper/core/document_processor.py`

**New Method**: `_validate_document_transaction_consistency()`

**Functionality**:

- Checks if document_type matches expected transaction_type
- Logs warnings for inconsistencies:

  ```text
  ⚠️  INCONSISTENT CLASSIFICATION: Document is an INVOICE but
  transaction type is 'expense'. Invoices should typically be
  INCOME transactions. This may indicate an extraction error.
  ```

- Does not fail the extraction (allows manual review)
- Logs successful consistent classifications at debug level

**Integration**:

- Called automatically in `process_document()` after LLM extraction
- Runs before transaction object creation
- Non-blocking (logs warnings but continues processing)

---

### 3. ✅ Created Comprehensive Documentation

**File**: `ACCOUNTING_TERMINOLOGY.md`

**Contents**:

- Detailed explanation of invoices vs receipts
- Accounting perspective and terminology
- Edge cases and clarifications
- Implementation rules for developers
- Test cases and validation requirements
- User-facing documentation

---

## Test Results

```bash
$ python test_accounting_terminology.py

✅ CORRECT: Invoice → Income (No warning)
✅ CORRECT: Receipt → Expense (No warning)
❌ INCORRECT: Invoice → Expense (⚠️  Warning logged)
❌ INCORRECT: Receipt → Income (⚠️  Warning logged)

✅ Prompt includes invoice→income guidance
✅ Prompt includes receipt→expense guidance
✅ Prompt emphasizes importance with CRITICAL/IMPORTANT
✅ Prompt uses strong language (MUST be)
```

## Expected Impact

### Before Fix

```text
invoice_software_license.pdf
   Document Type: invoice
   Transaction Type: expense  ← WRONG!
   Impact: Revenue incorrectly recorded as expense
```

### After Fix

```text
invoice_software_license.pdf
   Document Type: invoice
   Transaction Type: income  ← CORRECT!
   Impact: Revenue correctly recorded
```

---

## Validation Behavior

### Scenario 1: Correct Classification

```text
Document: invoice_consulting.pdf
LLM Returns: { document_type: "invoice", transaction_type: "income" }
Result: ✅ Validation passes silently, transaction created
```

### Scenario 2: Incorrect Classification

```text
Document: invoice_software.pdf
LLM Returns: { document_type: "invoice", transaction_type: "expense" }
Result: ⚠️  Warning logged:
  "INCONSISTENT CLASSIFICATION: Document is an INVOICE but
   transaction type is 'expense'. Invoices should typically
   be INCOME transactions. This may indicate an extraction error."
Action: Transaction still created, flagged for manual review
```

## Monitoring Recommendations

### What to Monitor

1. **Warning Frequency**: How often do misclassifications occur?
2. **Specific Documents**: Which documents trigger warnings?
3. **Provider Differences**: Do some LLM providers classify better?

### Log Analysis

```bash
# Find inconsistent classifications
grep "INCONSISTENT CLASSIFICATION" logs/agentic_bookkeeper.log

# Count by document type
grep "INCONSISTENT CLASSIFICATION" logs/*.log | grep -c "INVOICE"
grep "INCONSISTENT CLASSIFICATION" logs/*.log | grep -c "RECEIPT"
```

### Response Actions

- High warning rate → Review prompt effectiveness
- Specific documents → May need better document quality
- Provider-specific → Consider switching primary provider

---

## User Impact

### Positive Changes

- ✅ Correct income/expense classification
- ✅ Accurate financial reports
- ✅ Correct tax calculations
- ✅ Better audit trail (warnings logged)

### User Experience

- Transparent: Users see warnings if needed
- Non-blocking: Processing continues
- Reviewable: Flagged transactions can be manually verified
- Educational: Clear explanation of the issue

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Confidence Scoring**: Reduce confidence for inconsistent classifications
2. **Auto-Correction**: Automatically correct obvious misclassifications
3. **User Confirmation**: Prompt user to confirm unusual cases
4. **Machine Learning**: Learn from corrections to improve prompt
5. **Document Templates**: Pre-classify known document formats

### Integration Ideas

1. **Dashboard Flag**: Show warning icon for inconsistent transactions
2. **Bulk Review**: UI for reviewing flagged transactions
3. **Statistics**: Track classification accuracy over time
4. **Feedback Loop**: User corrections improve future classifications
