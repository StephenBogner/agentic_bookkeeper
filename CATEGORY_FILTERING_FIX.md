# Category Filtering Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Issue:** Transaction dialogs showing all categories regardless of transaction type
**User Request:** "In the Edit transaction widget the category dropdown should only have entries related to the Type. There should be more extensive Income categories."
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Problem Description

When editing or adding transactions, the category dropdown displayed **all categories** (both income and expense) regardless of which transaction type was selected. Additionally, there were **no income categories defined** in the system - only expense categories existed.

### Expected Behavior
- When transaction type is "income", show only income categories
- When transaction type is "expense", show only expense categories
- Have comprehensive income categories (not just expense categories)
- Categories should update dynamically when type is changed

### Actual Behavior
- All categories shown regardless of type selection
- Only expense categories existed (no income categories)
- Changing type didn't update available categories
- Made it confusing for users to select appropriate categories

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. No Income Categories Defined

**File:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/models/transaction.py:256-294` (BEFORE FIX)

The system only defined expense categories:
```python
CRA_CATEGORIES = [
    "Advertising",
    "Business tax, fees, licenses",
    "Insurance",
    # ... more expense categories ...
    "Other expenses",
]

IRS_CATEGORIES = [
    "Advertising",
    "Car and truck expenses",
    # ... more expense categories ...
    "Other expenses",
]
```

**No income categories existed at all.**

### 2. No Type Filtering in Category Function

**File:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/models/transaction.py:319-337` (BEFORE FIX)

```python
def get_categories_for_jurisdiction(jurisdiction: str) -> list:
    """Get list of valid categories for a tax jurisdiction."""
    if jurisdiction == "CRA":
        return CRA_CATEGORIES.copy()
    elif jurisdiction == "IRS":
        return IRS_CATEGORIES.copy()
    # ❌ No way to filter by transaction type!
```

The function had no mechanism to filter categories by transaction type.

### 3. Dialog Not Filtering Categories

**File:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/gui/transaction_edit_dialog.py:199-209` (BEFORE FIX)

```python
def _populate_categories(self) -> None:
    """Populate category dropdown based on tax jurisdiction."""
    categories = get_categories_for_jurisdiction(self.jurisdiction)
    self.category_combo.clear()
    self.category_combo.addItems(categories)
    # ❌ Loads ALL categories regardless of type
```

**File:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/gui/transaction_edit_dialog.py:261-269` (BEFORE FIX)

```python
def _on_type_changed(self, new_type: str) -> None:
    """Handle transaction type change."""
    self.logger.debug(f"Transaction type changed to: {new_type}")
    # Could update UI styling based on type if desired
    # ❌ Does nothing with categories!
```

Same issues existed in `transaction_add_dialog.py`.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Income Category Lists

**File:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/models/transaction.py:255-288`

Created comprehensive income categories for both jurisdictions:

```python
# Valid CRA income categories
CRA_INCOME_CATEGORIES = [
    "Professional services revenue",
    "Consulting revenue",
    "Sales revenue",
    "Service revenue",
    "Commission revenue",
    "Royalty revenue",
    "Rental income",
    "Interest income",
    "Investment income",
    "Other income",
]

# Valid CRA expense categories
CRA_EXPENSE_CATEGORIES = [
    "Advertising",
    "Business tax, fees, licenses",
    # ... existing expense categories ...
]

# Combined CRA categories (for backward compatibility)
CRA_CATEGORIES = CRA_INCOME_CATEGORIES + CRA_EXPENSE_CATEGORIES
```

Similar structure for IRS categories (with 12 income categories and 20 expense categories).

### 2. Enhanced Category Function with Type Filtering

**File:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/models/transaction.py:356-385`

```python
def get_categories_for_jurisdiction(
    jurisdiction: str,
    transaction_type: Optional[str] = None
) -> list:
    """
    Get list of valid categories for a tax jurisdiction,
    optionally filtered by transaction type.

    Args:
        jurisdiction: Tax jurisdiction ('CRA' or 'IRS')
        transaction_type: Optional filter by 'income' or 'expense'

    Returns:
        List of category names
    """
    if jurisdiction == "CRA":
        if transaction_type == "income":
            return CRA_INCOME_CATEGORIES.copy()
        elif transaction_type == "expense":
            return CRA_EXPENSE_CATEGORIES.copy()
        else:
            return CRA_CATEGORIES.copy()
    elif jurisdiction == "IRS":
        if transaction_type == "income":
            return IRS_INCOME_CATEGORIES.copy()
        elif transaction_type == "expense":
            return IRS_EXPENSE_CATEGORIES.copy()
        else:
            return IRS_CATEGORIES.copy()
    # ... error handling ...
```

### 3. Updated Edit Dialog to Filter Categories

**File:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/gui/transaction_edit_dialog.py`

**Lines 199-224:** Enhanced `_populate_categories()` method:
```python
def _populate_categories(self, transaction_type: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
    """Populate category dropdown based on tax jurisdiction and transaction type."""
    try:
        # Get current selection to preserve it if possible
        current_category = self.category_combo.currentText()

        # Get categories filtered by type
        categories = get_categories_for_jurisdiction(
            self.jurisdiction,
            transaction_type
        )
        self.category_combo.clear()
        self.category_combo.addItems(categories)

        # Try to restore previous selection if it's still valid
        if current_category and current_category in categories:
            self.category_combo.setCurrentText(current_category)
```

**Lines 277-286:** Updated `_on_type_changed()` to filter:
```python
def _on_type_changed(self, new_type: str) -> None:
    """Handle transaction type change."""
    self.logger.debug(f"Transaction type changed to: {new_type}")
    # Re-populate categories based on the new type
    self._populate_categories(transaction_type=new_type)
```

**Line 240:** Filter on load:
```python
def _load_transaction_data(self) -> None:
    # ... existing code ...

    # Re-populate categories based on transaction type
    self._populate_categories(transaction_type=self.transaction.type)

    # ... existing code ...
```

**Lines 115-121:** Removed premature population:
```python
# Category dropdown
self.category_combo = QComboBox()
# Categories will be populated in _load_transaction_data() with proper filtering
# ✓ No longer populates all categories here
```

### 4. Updated Add Dialog with Same Pattern

**File:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/gui/transaction_add_dialog.py`

Applied identical changes:
- Lines 189-214: Enhanced `_populate_categories()` with type parameter
- Lines 236-245: Updated `_on_type_changed()` to filter categories
- Line 228: Populate with default type in `_set_defaults()`
- Lines 113-119: Removed premature population

## Testing Instructions

### Test Add Transaction Dialog

1. **Start the application** and navigate to Transactions tab
2. **Click "Add Transaction"** button
3. **Verify default state:**
   - Type should be "expense"
   - Category dropdown should show **only expense categories**
4. **Change type to "income":**
   - Category dropdown should update to show **only income categories**
5. **Verify income categories** include:
   - "Consulting revenue"
   - "Professional services revenue"
   - "Sales revenue"
   - etc.
6. **Change back to "expense":**
   - Category dropdown should show **only expense categories**

### Test Edit Transaction Dialog

1. **Navigate to Transactions tab**
2. **Select an income transaction** (e.g., "Consulting Revenue")
3. **Click "Edit" button**
4. **Verify:**
   - Type shows "income"
   - Category dropdown shows **only income categories**
   - Current category is selected
5. **Change type to "expense":**
   - Category dropdown updates to show **only expense categories**
   - Previous selection cleared (since it's not valid for expenses)
6. **Cancel and select an expense transaction**
7. **Click "Edit" button**
8. **Verify:**
   - Type shows "expense"
   - Category dropdown shows **only expense categories**
   - Current category is selected

## Impact Analysis

### What This Fixes
✅ Transaction dialogs now filter categories by type
✅ Comprehensive income categories added (10 CRA, 12 IRS)
✅ Dynamic category updates when type changes
✅ Better data quality and user experience
✅ Tax-compliant category organization

### What This Prevents
✅ Users selecting expense categories for income transactions
✅ Users selecting income categories for expense transactions
✅ Data quality issues like "Other expenses" on income
✅ Confusion about which category to use
✅ Tax reporting errors from miscategorized transactions

### Backward Compatibility
✅ Existing code using `get_categories_for_jurisdiction(jurisdiction)` still works
✅ `CRA_CATEGORIES` and `IRS_CATEGORIES` still exist as combined lists
✅ No breaking changes to existing transaction validation
✅ Old transactions with legacy categories still load correctly

---

## Design Decisions

### Why Separate Income/Expense Lists?

**Reason:** Tax reporting and bookkeeping standards distinguish income from expenses

**Benefits:**
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain jurisdiction-specific categories
- Better alignment with tax forms (separate income/expense sections)
- Prevents user errors

### Why Optional Type Parameter?

**Reason:** Backward compatibility and flexibility

**Benefits:**
- Existing code doesn't break
- Can still get all categories when needed (e.g., for validation)
- Gradual migration path
- Flexible API

### Why Preserve Selection on Type Change?

**Reason:** Better user experience when category happens to be valid for both

**Example:**
- User has "Other income" selected
- Changes to expense type
- Would normally have "Other expenses" available
- Clearing selection forces reselection

**Current Behavior:**
- Only clears if category invalid for new type
- Preserves if category name exists in new list
- Reduces unnecessary user actions

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always define both income and expense data structures** for financial applications
2. **Type filtering is essential** for transaction categorization UIs
3. **Dynamic updates improve UX** - users expect dropdowns to respond to related field changes
4. **Preserve user selections when safe** - don't force unnecessary re-selection
5. **Backward compatibility matters** - optional parameters allow gradual migration

---

## Related Code Patterns

### Category Validation Pattern

The `validate_category()` function already checks if a category is valid:

```python
def validate_category(category: str, jurisdiction: str) -> bool:
    """Validate that a category is valid for the given tax jurisdiction."""
    if jurisdiction == "CRA":
        return category in CRA_CATEGORIES
    elif jurisdiction == "IRS":
        return category in IRS_CATEGORIES
```

This still works because `CRA_CATEGORIES` and `IRS_CATEGORIES` include both income and expense categories.

### Document Review Dialog

**File:** `src/agentic_bookkeeper/gui/document_review_dialog.py`

This dialog also uses `get_categories_for_jurisdiction()` but doesn't have a type selector. It shows all categories, which is appropriate for review purposes where the user determines the type as they review.

**No changes needed** - it will continue to work with `transaction_type=None` (default).
