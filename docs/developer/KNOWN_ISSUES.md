### P2-001: Currency Symbol Change Confirmation Dialog

**Source:** User Acceptance Testing (UAT Scenario 3)
**Category:** Usability Enhancement
**Discovered:** 2025-10-29

**Description:**
When users change the currency setting from USD to CAD (or vice versa), the change takes
effect immediately without confirmation. This could lead to confusion if clicked accidentally,
as all existing transaction amounts would display with the new currency symbol.

**Current Behavior:**

1. User selects new currency from dropdown in Settings
2. Currency changes immediately
3. All transaction displays update to new currency symbol
4. No confirmation or warning provided

**Requested Enhancement:**
Show a confirmation dialog when currency is changed:

- Message: "Changing currency will update the display of all transaction amounts. This does
  not convert values, only changes the symbol. Continue?"
- Buttons: "Continue" / "Cancel"
- Optional: "Don't show this again" checkbox

**Impact:** Low (currency is display-only, no calculation impact)

**Workaround:** Users can change currency back if changed accidentally

**Target Version:** v1.1 (Post-MVP enhancement)

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

- Add confirmation dialog to settings_dialog.py
- Implement "don't show again" preference
- Add unit tests for dialog behavior

The date range picker in the Reports widget works well with mouse/click interaction,
but lacks keyboard shortcuts for power users who prefer keyboard navigation.

**Current Behavior:**

- Date pickers require mouse clicks to open calendar
- Preset buttons (This Month, Last Quarter, etc.) require mouse clicks
- Keyboard users must tab through all controls

**Requested Enhancement:**
Add keyboard shortcuts for common date operations:

- `Ctrl+T`: This Month
- `Ctrl+Q`: This Quarter
- `Ctrl+Y`: This Year
- `Ctrl+L`: Last Month
- `Alt+Q`: Last Quarter
- `Alt+Y`: Last Year
- Arrow keys to navigate calendar when open
- Enter to select date, Escape to close calendar

**Impact:** Medium (improves efficiency for power users)

**Workaround:** Mouse/click interaction works correctly

**Target Version:** v1.2 (Future enhancement)

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours

- Implement keyboard event handlers in reports_widget.py
- Add keyboard shortcuts to UI (tooltip hints)
- Update user documentation with keyboard shortcuts
- Add unit tests for keyboard interactions

## 4. Low-Priority Enhancements (P3)

### P3-001: IRS as Default for US Users

**Source:** User Acceptance Testing (UAT Scenario 1)
**Category:** Localization Enhancement
**Discovered:** 2025-10-29

**Description:**
First-run initialization defaults to CRA (Canada) tax jurisdiction. US users must manually
change to IRS, which is an extra step during setup.

**Current Behavior:**

- Default jurisdiction: CRA (Canada)
- Default currency: USD
- Users must manually select IRS if in United States

**Requested Enhancement:**
Auto-detect user location and set appropriate defaults:

- Use system locale or IP geolocation to detect country
- Set jurisdiction automatically (CRA for Canada, IRS for US)
- Set currency based on country (CAD for Canada, USD for US)
- Show confirmation: "Detected United States - using IRS tax codes. Is this correct?"

**Impact:** Low (one-time setup step, easily changed)

**Workaround:** Users can manually select IRS during first-run setup

**Target Version:** v1.3 (Future enhancement)

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours

- Implement locale detection
- Add country-to-jurisdiction mapping

### P3-002: Confidence Scores for Extracted Data

**Source:** User Acceptance Testing (UAT Scenario 2)
**Category:** AI/ML Enhancement
**Discovered:** 2025-10-29

**Description:**
When LLM providers extract transaction data from documents, they don't provide confidence
scores. Users cannot easily identify which extractions might need verification.

**Current Behavior:**

- LLM extracts: date, vendor, amount, category, description
- All extracted fields treated equally
- No indication of extraction confidence
- Users must verify all extractions manually

**Requested Enhancement:**
Display confidence scores for extracted data:

- Request confidence scores from LLM (if provider supports it)
- Show confidence indicators in Document Review Dialog:
  - 🟢 High confidence (>90%): Green indicator
  - 🟡 Medium confidence (70-90%): Yellow indicator
  - 🔴 Low confidence (<70%): Red indicator
- Auto-flag low-confidence fields for user review
- Sort by confidence in review list

**Benefits:**

- Focus user attention on uncertain extractions
- Improve data quality through targeted verification
- Build user trust through transparency

**Impact:** Low (current accuracy is already good: 100% date/vendor/amount, 80% category)

**Workaround:** Users review all documents manually

**Target Version:** v2.0 (Requires LLM provider API changes)

**Estimated Effort:** 12 hours

- Update LLM provider interface to return confidence scores
- Modify extraction response structure
- Add confidence display to Document Review Dialog
- Implement flagging logic for low-confidence extractions
- Update unit tests

**Dependencies:** Requires LLM provider support for confidence scores

### P3-003: OR Logic for Transaction Filters

**Source:** User Acceptance Testing (UAT Scenario 3)
**Category:** Feature Enhancement
**Discovered:** 2025-10-29

**Description:**
The Transactions widget supports filtering by type, category, date range, and search text.
All filters use AND logic. Users cannot easily find "all Meals OR Entertainment expenses".

**Current Behavior:**

- Multiple category selections use AND logic (must match all - not useful)
- Cannot filter "Type=Expense AND (Category=Meals OR Category=Entertainment)"
- Workaround: Apply filters multiple times and combine results manually

**Requested Enhancement:**
Add OR logic option for category filters:

- Radio buttons: "Match ALL categories (AND)" / "Match ANY category (OR)"
- Enable multi-select for categories with OR logic
- Example: Select "Meals" + "Entertainment" + OR = show all Meals or Entertainment expenses

**Impact:** Low (current AND logic works for most use cases)

**Workaround:** Filter by one category at a time, or use search text

**Target Version:** v1.4 (Future enhancement)

**Estimated Effort:** 6 hours

- Add logic selector to Transactions widget UI
- Update filter logic in transaction manager
- Update query builder for OR conditions
- Unit tests for OR logic
- Update user documentation

### P3-004: User Notification for Failed Documents

**Source:** User Acceptance Testing (UAT Scenario 14)
**Category:** Monitoring Enhancement
**Discovered:** 2025-10-29

**Description:**
When document processing fails during automated monitoring, the failure is logged but
the user is not actively notified. Users must check the dashboard or logs to discover
failed documents.

**Current Behavior:**

- Failed documents are logged: "Failed to process PDF: File appears corrupted"
- Error logged with timestamp and details
- No pop-up notification or visual alert
- Users must check dashboard statistics to see failures

**Requested Enhancement:**
Add user notifications for failed documents:

- Desktop notification (system tray) for processing failures
- In-app notification badge on Dashboard tab
- Failed documents list in Dashboard with "Retry" option
- Email notification (optional, for unattended monitoring)

**Benefits:**

- Immediate awareness of processing failures
- Faster response to issues
- Better user experience during automated monitoring

**Impact:** Low (monitoring works correctly, errors are logged)

**Workaround:** Users can check dashboard statistics and logs

**Target Version:** v1.2 (Future enhancement)

**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours

- Implement desktop notification system (platform-specific)
- Add notification badge to Dashboard tab
- Create failed documents list UI
- Add retry functionality
- Optional: Email notification system
- Unit tests for notification logic

## 5. Security Recommendations

### Security #1: Set MACHINE_ID in Production

**Source:** Security Testing (T-043)
**Category:** Security Configuration
**Priority:** Critical (before v1.0 release)
**Discovered:** 2025-10-29

**Description:**
The encryption key derivation uses MACHINE_ID environment variable. If not set, it falls
back to a default value, reducing security for multi-installation scenarios.

**Current Behavior:**

- MACHINE_ID environment variable optional
- Falls back to default if not set
- Works correctly but reduces isolation between installations

**Recommendation:**
For production deployments:

1. Require MACHINE_ID environment variable
2. Fail startup if MACHINE_ID not set in production mode
3. Generate unique MACHINE_ID during installation
4. Document in deployment guide

**Implementation Plan:**

```python
# In utils/config.py
def _get_machine_id() -> str:
    machine_id = os.getenv("MACHINE_ID")
    if machine_id is None:
        if self._is_production_mode():
            raise RuntimeError("MACHINE_ID environment variable required in production")
        else:
            logger.warning("MACHINE_ID not set, using default (development only)")
            return "default-dev-machine-id"
    return machine_id
```

**Risk if not addressed:** Low (affects encrypted storage isolation)

**Target Version:** v1.0 (Before production release)

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

- Add production mode detection
- Add MACHINE_ID requirement in production
- Update deployment documentation
- Add unit tests

---

### Security #2: Unique Salt for Key Derivation

**Source:** Security Testing (T-043)
**Category:** Cryptographic Enhancement
**Priority:** Low (only if implementing encrypted storage at rest)
**Discovered:** 2025-10-29

**Description:**
If implementing encrypted API key storage on disk (not currently active), the key
derivation uses a static salt. Unique salt per installation would enhance security.

**Current Status:**

- Encrypted storage not actively used (API keys from environment variables)
- Static salt defined in config.py
- Issue only relevant if storing keys on disk

**Recommendation:**
If implementing encrypted storage at rest:

1. Generate unique salt during first installation
2. Store salt in separate secure location (not in .env)
3. Use salt for key derivation with PBKDF2

**Risk if not addressed:** Low (only applicable if encrypted storage implemented)

**Target Version:** v2.0 (If encrypted storage feature added)

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours

- Salt generation on first run
- Secure salt storage mechanism
- Update encryption implementation
- Unit tests

**Note:** Not required for current implementation using environment variables

### Security #3: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

**Source:** Security Testing (T-043)
**Category:** Supply Chain Security
**Priority:** Medium (before v1.0 release)
**Discovered:** 2025-10-29

**Description:**
No automated dependency vulnerability scanning is currently configured. Dependencies
should be checked for known security vulnerabilities before each release.

**Recommendation:**
Implement automated dependency scanning:

1. **Tool Selection:** Use `pip-audit` or `safety`

   ```bash
   pip install pip-audit
   pip-audit
   ```

2. **Schedule:** Run before every release and periodically

3. **CI/CD Integration:** Add to GitHub Actions workflow

   ```yaml
   - name: Security Scan
     run: |
       pip install pip-audit
       pip-audit --require-hashes --strict
   ```

4. **Response Plan:**
   - Critical: Update immediately
   - High: Update before release
   - Medium: Schedule for next sprint
   - Low: Document and monitor

**Benefits:**

- Early detection of vulnerable dependencies
- Proactive security posture
- Compliance with security best practices

**Target Version:** v1.0 (Before production release)

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours

- Install and configure pip-audit
- Create scanning script
- Add to CI/CD pipeline (if applicable)
- Document scanning process
- Create vulnerability response procedure

### Security #4: Backup Encryption (Related to P2-003)

**Source:** Security Testing (T-043) + UAT
**Category:** Data Protection
**Priority:** Medium (when backup feature implemented)
**Discovered:** 2025-10-29

**Description:**
If automatic backup feature (P2-003) is implemented, backups should be encrypted
to protect sensitive financial data.

**Recommendation:**
When implementing automatic backup (P2-003):

1. Encrypt backups using Fernet (same as API key encryption)
2. Use MACHINE_ID for key derivation
3. Store encrypted backups separate from main database
4. Implement secure backup rotation (delete old backups securely)

**Implementation:**

```python
# Encrypt backup before saving
encrypted_backup = self.config.encrypt_api_key(backup_data)
with open(backup_path, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(encrypted_backup)
```

**Target Version:** v1.1 (Same as P2-003 backup feature)

**Estimated Effort:** Included in P2-003 estimate (8 hours)

## 6. Performance Optimization Opportunities

### Optimization #1: Database Indexes

**Source:** Performance Testing (T-042)
**Category:** Performance Enhancement
**Priority:** Low (current performance acceptable)

**Current Performance:** Good (queries <50ms for <1000 transactions)

**Optimization Opportunity:**
Add indexes for frequently queried columns when database grows beyond 10,000 transactions:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_date ON transactions(date);
CREATE INDEX idx_type ON transactions(type);
CREATE INDEX idx_category ON transactions(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_date_type ON transactions(date, type);
```

**Expected Improvement:** 2-5x speedup for large datasets (>10,000 transactions)

**Target:** Implement when user dataset exceeds 5,000 transactions

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

---

### Optimization #2: Parallel Document Processing

**Source:** Performance Testing (T-042)
**Category:** Performance Enhancement
**Priority:** Low (current performance acceptable)

**Current Performance:** Sequential processing (~2-3s per document)

**Optimization Opportunity:**
Process multiple documents in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(process_document, doc) for doc in documents]
    results = [f.result() for f in futures]
```

**Expected Improvement:** 2-4x speedup for batch processing

**Considerations:**

- LLM provider rate limits
- API cost implications (faster = more API calls per minute)
- Memory usage (multiple documents in memory)

**Target:** Implement when users regularly process 10+ documents at once

**Estimated Effort:** 6 hours

---

### Optimization #3: Report Template Pre-compilation

**Source:** Performance Testing (T-042)
**Category:** Performance Enhancement
**Priority:** Low (current performance excellent <5s)

**Current Performance:** Excellent (reports generate in 1-2s for 1000 transactions)

**Optimization Opportunity:**
Pre-compile report templates on startup to save 100-200ms per report generation.

**Expected Improvement:** Marginal (10-20% faster report generation)

**Target:** Not prioritized (current performance already exceeds targets)

**Estimated Effort:** 3 hours

---

## 7. Test Coverage Gaps

### Gap #1: Logger Module Coverage

**Source:** Test Coverage Report
**Current Coverage:** 0% for `utils/logger.py`

**Note:** Logger module is tested indirectly through integration tests (all modules use
logging and tests verify log output). Direct unit tests not added to avoid complexity
of mocking logging infrastructure.

**Status:** ✅ Acceptable (tested indirectly)

**Action:** No action required

---

### Gap #2: Config Module Coverage

**Source:** Test Coverage Report
**Current Coverage:** 63% for `utils/config.py`

**Uncovered Lines:** Encryption functions (119-120, 128-134, etc.)

**Note:** Encryption functions tested indirectly through Settings dialog tests. Not
tested directly because they require environment variable setup and encryption keys.

**Status:** ✅ Acceptable (tested indirectly through GUI)

**Action:** Consider adding direct encryption tests in future if implementing
encrypted storage at rest
