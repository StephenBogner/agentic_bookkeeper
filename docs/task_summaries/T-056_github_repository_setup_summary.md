## Implementation Notes

### Key Decisions

1. **Release Notes Format**: Created comprehensive 650+ line document covering all aspects
   - Rationale: Professional release notes boost user confidence and reduce support burden
   - Alternative: Could have used brief release notes, but comprehensive is better for v0.1.0

2. **Issue Templates**: Provided structured templates with checkboxes and dropdowns
   - Rationale: Improves issue quality and reduces back-and-forth with reporters
   - Alternative: Could have used simple templates, but structured approach saves time

3. **Repository Topics**: Selected 9 relevant topics for discoverability
   - Rationale: Helps users discover the project through GitHub search
   - Topics: python, ai, bookkeeping, llm, pyside6, automation, sqlite, tax, finance

4. **Artifacts**: Included both wheel and source distributions
   - Rationale: Provides installation flexibility for users
   - Wheel for quick pip install, source for inspection/modification

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Backup Files**: Initial git add included backup files (PROJECT_STATUS.md.backup, =3.0.0)
   - Solution: Reset staging, excluded backup files, removed stray files

2. **Issue Template API**: GitHub API call for templates returned 404
   - Solution: Verified templates exist locally and in repository via JSON API
   - Note: Templates are functional despite API error

### Best Practices Applied

- Used GitHub CLI (gh) for streamlined operations
- Created comprehensive release notes (650+ lines)
- Professional issue templates with validation checkboxes
- Repository topics for discoverability
- Template chooser config with documentation links
- Clear, descriptive commit message with co-authorship

### Patterns Established

**GitHub Release Workflow:**
1. Create repository (gh repo create)
2. Commit and push code
3. Create annotated tag (git tag -a)
4. Push tag to origin
5. Create GitHub release with artifacts (gh release create)
6. Configure repository settings (gh repo edit)

**Issue Template Structure:**
- YAML front matter (name, title, labels)
- Markdown body with structured sections
- Checkboxes for validation steps
- Dropdown selections where applicable
- Template chooser config for documentation links

## Key Learnings

1. **GitHub CLI Efficiency**: `gh` commands significantly streamline repository operations compared to web UI
2. **Release Notes Impact**: Comprehensive release notes (650+ lines) boost user confidence and adoption
3. **Issue Template Value**: Structured templates dramatically improve issue quality and reduce support burden
4. **Repository Discoverability**: Topics are crucial for GitHub search discoverability (9 topics added)
5. **Template Chooser**: config.yml can redirect users to documentation before creating issues
6. **Artifact Strategy**: Include both wheel and source distributions for installation flexibility
7. **Professional Appearance**: Repository description, topics, and README are first impressions - make them count

### Technical Insights

- GitHub release URL format: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases/tag/{tag}`
- Issue template format: YAML front matter + Markdown body
- Repository topics improve search ranking and categorization
- Release artifacts can be uploaded during `gh release create`
- Template chooser config links users to docs (reduces noise)

### Process Improvements

- Always verify artifact files exist before creating release
- Clean staging area of backup files before committing
- Use descriptive repository topics relevant to project domain
- Create comprehensive release notes for major versions
- Link issue templates to relevant documentation
