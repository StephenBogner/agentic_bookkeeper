## Implementation Notes

### Structured Logging Helpers

Three new helper functions provide consistent structured logging across the application:

1. **log_operation_start()**: Logs operation start with context
   - Format: "Operation started: {operation} key1=value1 key2=value2"
   - Use at beginning of operations for audit trail

2. **log_operation_success()**: Logs successful completion with metrics
   - Format: "Operation succeeded: {operation} duration_ms=123.45 key1=value1"
   - Automatically includes duration if provided
   - Useful for performance tracking

3. **log_operation_failure()**: Logs operation failures with error details
   - Format: "Operation failed: {operation} error={ErrorType} message={msg} key1=value1"
   - Captures error type and message automatically
   - Includes context for debugging

### Enhanced Modules

**document_processor.py**:

- Logs operation start with document name and LLM provider
- Logs success with duration, confidence score
- Logs failures with duration for performance analysis
- Fixed bug: start_time now initialized before validation checks

**report_generator.py**:

- Logs report generation start with type, date range, jurisdiction
- Logs success with duration, transaction count, net amount
- Logs failures with duration and report type
- Wrapped in try/except for complete error coverage

**pdf_exporter.py**:

- Logs PDF export start with report type and output path
- Logs success with duration and file size in KB
- Logs failures with duration and report type
- Provides detailed performance metrics

### Test Coverage

Created test_logger.py with 29 comprehensive tests:

**SensitiveDataFilter Tests (9 tests)**:

- API key filtering (colon and equals separators)
- Bearer token filtering
- OpenAI key pattern filtering (sk-...)
- Credit card number filtering
- Password filtering
- Log args filtering
- No false positives verification

**LoggerSetup Tests (8 tests)**:

- Handler creation (file + console)
- Console-only mode
- Sensitive data filter application
- Log rotation by size
- Log rotation backup count
- Log level filtering

**Context Manager Tests (3 tests)**:

- temporary_log_level changes level
- Restores original level
- Restores handler levels

**Structured Logging Tests (6 tests)**:

- log_operation_start with context
- log_operation_success with/without duration
- log_operation_failure with error details
- No context handling
- Special characters in context

**Additional Tests (3 tests)**:

- get_logger returns Logger instance
- setup_logging creates logger
- Log rotation actually works

### Key Learnings

1. **Structured logging improves debugging**: Including operation context, duration, and results in logs makes troubleshooting much easier

2. **Performance metrics in logs**: Duration tracking helps identify slow operations without separate profiling

3. **Sensitive data filtering**: Filter must run on both log message and args to catch all leaks

4. **Log rotation essential**: Without rotation, log files grow unbounded in production

5. **Start time initialization**: Must initialize timing variables early to avoid UnboundLocalError in exception handlers

6. **Context managers for testing**: temporary_log_level context manager useful for testing different log levels

7. **Test coverage validation**: Log rotation tests verify file creation, backup count, and size limits
