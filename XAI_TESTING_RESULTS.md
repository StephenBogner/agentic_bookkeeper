## Technical Implementation Notes

### API Configuration

```python
from agentic_bookkeeper.llm.xai_provider import XAIProvider

# Default configuration (recommended)
provider = XAIProvider(api_key=api_key)
# Uses grok-4-fast-non-reasoning by default

# Production settings
provider = XAIProvider(
    api_key=api_key,
    model="grok-4-fast-non-reasoning",
    temperature=0.1,  # Low for consistent extraction
    max_tokens=1000
)
```

### Environment Configuration

```bash
export XAI_API_KEY="your-xai-api-key"
export LLM_PROVIDER="xai"
```

### Performance Tuning

**Optimal Settings for Financial Documents**:
- Model: `grok-4-fast-non-reasoning`
- Temperature: 0.1 (deterministic extraction)
- Max Tokens: 1000 (sufficient for structured data)

## Known Limitations

### Minor Issues Observed

1. **Date Variations**: Some dates extracted with slight year differences (e.g., 2023 vs 2025)
   - Impact: Minor, can be validated against system date
   - Mitigation: Add date validation logic

2. **Category Assignments**: Occasionally uses generic categories
   - Example: "Other expenses" instead of specific category
   - Impact: Low, still accurate accounting
   - Mitigation: Category mapping post-processing

3. **Minor Text Variations**: Small differences in descriptions
   - Example: "45.L" vs "45.2L"
   - Impact: Minimal, core data correct
   - Mitigation: None needed

**Overall**: These are very minor issues that don't affect the quality of financial data extraction.
