## WORKFLOW USAGE

### Using the /next-task Command

The /next-task command is your automated task execution workflow. It:

1. Reads the NEXT_TASK_SPEC from WORKFLOW_STATE
2. Loads the task specification
3. Reads CONTEXT.md for cross-task knowledge
4. Executes the task
5. Updates PROJECT_STATUS.md with results
6. Prepares for the next task

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Execute the next task
/next-task

# After task completion, it automatically updates:
# - CURRENT_TASK → (next task ID)
# - LAST_TASK_COMPLETED → (completed task ID)
# - NEXT_TASK_ID → (following task ID)
# - NEXT_TASK_SPEC → (path to next task spec)
```text

### Creating New Tasks

1. Copy example task: `cp specs/PHASE_1/SPRINT_1/T-001_example_task.md specs/PHASE_1/SPRINT_1/T-002_new_task.md`
2. Edit task specification with requirements
3. Update NEXT_TASK_ID and NEXT_TASK_SPEC in WORKFLOW_STATE
4. Run /next-task

### Adding New Sprints

When Sprint 1 is complete:

1. Create Sprint 2 section in this file
2. Create directory: `mkdir -p specs/PHASE_1/SPRINT_2`
3. Create task specifications in new directory
4. Update NEXT_TASK_SPEC to point to first Sprint 2 task

### Adding New Phases

When Phase 1 is complete:

1. Create Phase 2 section in this file
2. Create directory: `mkdir -p specs/PHASE_2/SPRINT_1`
3. Define phase objectives and sprint goals
4. Create task specifications
5. Update NEXT_TASK_SPEC to point to first Phase 2 task
