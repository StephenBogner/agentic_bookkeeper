2. **PDF Conversion**: PDFs not converted to images for LLM vision APIs (✅ RESOLVED - PyMuPDF at 300 DPI)
3. **Null Value Handling**: Transaction creation crash on null values (✅ RESOLVED - safe_float() helper)
4. **XAI Provider**: Abstract method implementation missing (✅ RESOLVED - complete rewrite)
5. **Google Provider**: Abstract method implementation missing (✅ RESOLVED - complete rewrite)
6. **Accounting Terminology**: Invoice/receipt classification errors (✅ RESOLVED - validation + prompt updates)
